# JS Error Tracking

## About this Nerdpack

> Write one or two short paragraphs that describe what your app doesâ€”and more importantly, why users should care. Avoid too much technical jargon: Your content should be understandable to someone who doesn't have much knowledge of New Relic's technologies. And include links to New Relic docs or other apps.
>
> For example:

This application show you "Events" just before the JavaScript error happened. You can easy to know what the customer did. You don't need to ask but just see this Nerdlet to grasp customers operation, then no many time needed to reproduce the error.

## What do you need to make this work?

> List any prerequisites for using your app, and include links to other New Relic features when necessary.
>
> For example:

Required:

- [New Relic Browser agent(s) installed](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent) on your web application and the related access to [New Relic One](https://newrelic.com/platform).

## Getting started

> Include a step-by-step procedure on how to get your app installed and deployed. The clone and deploy steps are similar across all apps. If your app has additional steps required to get started, include them here or in their own section.

1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following commands. (If you have them installed, these commands return a version number; if not, the commands aren't recognized.)
```bash
git --version
npm -v
```
2. Install the [NR1 CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [the developer center](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher), and following the instructions to install and set up your New Relic development environment. This should take about 5 minutes.
3. Execute the following command to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data:

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nr1-js-error-tracking.git
cd nr1-js-error-tracking
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

## Deploying this Nerdpack

> Include the necessary steps to deploy your app. Generally, you shouldn't need to change any of these steps.

Open a command prompt in the app's directory and run the following commands.

```bash
# If you need to create a new uuid for the account to which you're deploying this app, use the following
# nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g [--profile=your_profile_name]
# to see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment, run nr1 credentials:list
nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
```
